The DeepGreen project mission is to bring leading French partners from research and industry together with hardware solutions vendors to develop a dedicated embedded AI software platform. This platform is to offer reliable and powerful solutions for deploying low-energy, low-memory embedded AI applications that meet not only the needs of industry, but also the imperatives of the environment. In this context, the DeepGreen collective is leading the development of the first independent and sovereign software platform dedicated to embedded AI, the [Eclipse Aidge platform](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/aidge/aidge).

The Eclipse Aidge platform enables the design of high-performance and efficient deep neural networks while taking into account the constrained environment for which they are intended. It aims to offer a set of tools and features that reduce the computational complexity and memory consumption of models, select the best hardware target, and generate an optimized implementation in the appropriate programming model.

CEA is the coordinator and one of the main contributor of this platform.
