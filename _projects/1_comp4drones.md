The Comp4Drones project was a European Commission funded project that aimed atproviding a framework of key enabling technologies for safe and autonomous drones. It brings to bear a holistically designed ecosystem from application to electronic components, realized as a tightly integrated multi-vendor and compositional UAV embedded architecture solution and a tool chain complementing the compositional architecture principles.

The project was mainly focused on the following objectives:

1. Ease the integration and customization of embedded drone systems.
2. Enable drones to take safe autonomous decisions.
3. Ensure the deployment of trusted communications.
4. Minimize the design and verification effort for complex drone applications
5. Ensuring sustainable impact and creation of an industry-driven community.
