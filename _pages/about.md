I'm a research engineer at the CEA-List Institute, Laboratory of Embedded and Autonomous Systems (LSEA), in France, where I delve into the fascinating world of trustworthy deep learning for automated systems. I actively contribute to cutting-edge, industry-driven projects on Trustworthy AI, funded by the European Union and the French government. My work is not just a job; it's a mission to ensure that the AI technologies shaping our future are both innovative and reliable.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Université Paris-Saclay, France, which has provided me with a solid academic foundation that fuels my professional endeavors.
My main research interests lie in uncertainty estimation in DNNs, out-of-distribution detection in DNN-based computer vision components, LLMs & VLMs hallucination detection, and world models. My work is particularly focused on embodied AI for automated robots and autonomous vehicles applications, where precision and reliability are paramount.

My journey in the tech world began with a BSc. in electronis and telecommunications from Universidad Privada Boliviana (UPB), in my home country, Bolivia. Then, I was fortunate enough to win the <a href='https://www.isea.supsi.ch/en/reteca-foundation'>RETECA foundation scholarship</a> to pursue my MSc. studies in Switzerland. By following an MSc. in embedded systems and microelectronics from the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), I first honed my skills and developed a keen interest in the intricacies of intelligent systems.
